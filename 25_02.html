	  <h2>Types of equations.</h2>
		<body bgcolor ="powderblue">






<p><h3><font color = "brown" size= "4" face ="Sans-Serif"> An example of an equation involving x and y as unknowns and the parameter R is

 <u>x<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup></u>.

When R is chosen to have the value of 2 (R = 2), this equation would be recognized in Cartesian coordinates as the equation for the circle of radius of 2 around the origin. Hence, the equation with R unspecified is the general equation for the circle.</br>
</br>
<i>Usually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, x, y, z, w, ..., while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the beginning, a, b, c, d, ... . For example, the general quadratic equation is usually written ax<Sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0.</h3></i>




<b>Equations can be classified according to the types of operations and quantities involved. Important types include:</b>

<ul><li>An algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials (see also system of polynomial equations). These are further classified by degree:</li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>linear equation for degree one.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>quadratic equation for degree two.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>cubic equation for degree three.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>quartic equation for degree four.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>quintic equation for degree five.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>sextic equation for degree six.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>septic equation for degree seven.</ul></li>
<ul type="cirlce"><li>octic equation for degree eight</ul></li>
